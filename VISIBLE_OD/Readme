Hi Sergio,
The attachment are the files that you wanted.

The data in the ring factor is the the normalized factor. The third column
is the differentiate of the second column.

For the ozone data: Note that the second,
third, and fourth columns are the coefficients for the ozone cross
section ( c0 + c1*Tc + c2*Tc*Tc), but note that the units here are
1/(atm*cm).  The next column is the Rayleigh optical depth at 1 atm,
and the final column is the Rayleigh depolarization factor.
