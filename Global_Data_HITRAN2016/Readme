wherever you see 2012, replace with 2017
      CALL TIPS_2017(iMol,rTemp,iI,iG*1.d0,rQT)
      include 'TIPS_2017_try_include1.f'

mv BD_ISO_2016.for BD_ISO_2016.FOR
mv BD_ISO_82_to_85.for BD_ISO_82_TO_85.FOR

edit BD_ISO_82_TO_85.FOR (the "returns" and "continues" are wierd!!!!)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

cp ../Global_Data_HITRAN2012/TIPS_2012_try_include1.f TIPS_2017_try_include1.f
basically keep the first few lines, change 2012 to 2017
C***********************
cs      Program TIPS_2017
C*********************** 
C    Program TIPS_2017 written by R.R. Gamache


C***********************
      Subroutine TIPS_2017(
     I MOL,		! HITRAN molecule number
     I Temp,		! temperature in K
     I NSO82,		! isotopomer index  should really be eg 161 or 181 0r 171 for Water
     O gi,		! state independent degeneracy factor
     O QT)		! total internal partition sum
C*********************** 

then include and edit TIPS_2017_v1p0.for

(1) these are new variables
      INTEGER NT,I,IT
      INTEGER MOL,NS082
      DOUBLE PRECISION Temp,QT,gi
      character*30 stopNgo
(2) these are redefined variabes
      COMMON/Temperatures/tdat
     c      COMMON/Temperatures/tdat(NT)
      REAL tmax(NMOL,Max_ISO)
     c      dimension Tmax(NMOL,Max_ISO)

(3) edit out their input prompts
     I have comments "cs" in columns 1-2, have demarkrcated them using
cs >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
cs >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     
and set the isotope
cs       CALL ISO_82_TO_85 (MOL,NSO82,ISO)
       ISO = NSO82

(4) edit the common statement so that
      COMMON/Temperatures/tdat(NT)
becomes      
      REAL tdat(NT)
      COMMON/Temperatures/tdat

(5) molecule 34 is a mess, the max temp was set at 10.0 and the gi,Q were set as 0. So edited this to become
c      data Tmax(34,1)/10./  ! HO2
      data Tmax(34,1)/1000./  ! HO2  SERGIO
and
      IF(MOL.EQ.34) THEN
      c...not applicable to O
      c      gi=0
      c     QT = 0.
      c sergio
            gi=1
            QT = 1.
       go to 100
      ENDIF

(6) modify the output lines so that nothing is printed from TIPS_2017_try_include1.f, and the loop does not keep executing
 100  if(QT .gt. 0.) then

c        Write(*,900) MOLID(Mol), NSO82, Temp, QT, gi
c  900 format(//,5x,A6,' Molecule',3x,i5,' Isotopologue',/,
c     + 5x,'Q(',f7.1,' K) = ',1pE12.4,5x,'State Independent factor=',
c     + 0pf7.1,////)

c      write (*,901) QT,Mol,NSO82, Temp,gi
 901  format (0pf17.12,i5,i5,f17.12,i5)
      else
        print *,NSO82, Temp, QT, gi
        write(*,'(A23,A6)') ' No data available for ',MOLID(MOL)
      endif
c      go to 10
c  99  STOP 'Computation finished'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

in BD_ISO_82_to_85.for and BD_MOL_2016.FOR and BD_ISO_2016.for change all
           Species_2016.cmn to Species_2016.cmn
           Isotops.cmn      to Isotops.cmn
	   MOLEC.cmn        to MOLEC.CMN
