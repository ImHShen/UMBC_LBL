Regarding the line shape, it is true that the replacement of the Voigt
line shape has gained some momentum. The IUPAC task group has even
explicitly recommended the adoption of the Hartmann-Tran line shape
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7782.pdf). I am not sure to what extend
this would affect the simulation of TOA infared radiances. As you say,
it is perhaps more relevant for NIR-UV applications but it would be
nice to see some numbers. I have spoken to Keith Shine and Eli Mlawer
and they did not seem over excited over the prospect of moving away
from the canonical Voigt line shape. In particular, Eli mentioned the
fact that the formulation of the Hartmann-Tran line shape is very
computationally expensive and that to be able to implement it in a LBL
model it would require some serious work (i.e. parameterisation) which
could eventually results in a loss of accuracy.
