To adjust CKD 2
================

Best thing is, fo you to login as "me" so you do not have to worry about 
copying over the entire SPECTRA directory structure.


/home/sergio/SPECTRA/CKDLINUX/calconCKD2.0.f

look for the line that says 
FNAME = '/home/sergio/SPECTRA/CKDLINUX/tunmlt_con1_14jul03.dat'

and modify it so it has the new "fname" that you want to read.
The data is in the following format (from Scott)

  % Tuning multipliers to be applied to SARTA optical depths  
  %
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  % 14 July 2003: estimatee of window fixes for "con1" using ARM TWP

At the unix shell, type "makewatermexLinux" to MEX the file

To make the data files for kCARTA to read, run
    ckd_lookupBIN_ieee_le.m

This will automatically produce the binary files for the new CKD2
The files will be stored in /asl/data/kcarta/KCARTADATA/General/CKDieee_le/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To put in mystery gas into kCARTA
==================================

You will need to copy /home/sergio/KCARTA/SRC/rad_main.f and edit it
Set iMystery = +1 to read in adjustment file 
    /asl/data/kcarta/KCARTADATA/General/mystery.dat
Then compile (type "make") and run

The colmns in this file are :
    Wavenumber   OpticalDepth

kCARTA will linearly interp the values onto the 0.0025 cm-1 spacing, and
add on these optical depths onto the lowest complete layer above the surface
