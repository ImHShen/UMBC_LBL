Dear Sergio
please find attached some fortran software and two data files that should be used as follows
  rewvn2continuum.zip
  
- The subroutine "LECN2" should be called early, likely the best is to call it in the main program. It reads the two
ASCII data files, named "CT-N2.N2" and "CT-N2.H2O"

- Then whenever you need a value of the CIA by N2, you use the FUNCTION "CTN2(SIGMA,PN2,PH2O,PTOT,T)"
where SIGMA, PN2, PH2O, PTOT, T are input values of the wavenumber (cm-1), the N2 partial pressure (atm),
the H2O partial pressure (atm), the total pressure (atm), and the temperature (K). This function returns "CTN2" which is
the N2 absorption coefficient (in cm-1) at wavenumber sigma for the chosen input gas conditions

Note that everything is in Double precision

Please keep me informed of your progresses/results or problems

Best regards
Jean-Michel
