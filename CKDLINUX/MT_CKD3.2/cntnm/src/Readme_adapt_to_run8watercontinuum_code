cp cntnm_progr.f90 cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
   edit cntnm_progr_sergio.f90 so that parameters are input through keyboard (or file)
   basically insert junk1.f90 at the beginning

then edit so you get rid of inputting params, and now they come in as arguments
   see  >>>>> begin edit input params >>>>
   see  >>>>>   end edit input params >>>>   

then edit so that WK(X) is set according to what is input
   see  >>>>> begin edit WK(X) >>>>
   see  >>>>>   end edit WK(X) >>>>   

then edit so that start/stop wavenumver set according to what is input
   see  >>>>> begin edit V1V2DV >>>>
   see  >>>>>   end edit V1V2DV >>>>   

modify       CALL CONTNM(JRAD)  to       CALL CONTNM(JRAD,rXSelf,rXforn)

modify the do 100 I=1,NPTABS loop

modify the do 200 i=1,npth   loop

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

now go
  cp contnm.f90 contnm_sergio.f90

and edit so
    SUBRT CONTNM(JRAD)  to       SUBR CONTNM(JRAD,rXSelf,rXforn)  has 3 arguments!
and edit so you also have
      parameter (n_absrb=150050)
      parameter (nc=160000)

also edit so that c_f is multiplied by rXForn and c_s by rXSelf

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

FINALLY EDIT cntnm_progr_sergio.f90 so that
  main program is in driver_cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
  and it then includes cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
  
and everything from
  SUBROUTINE CALCON_MTCKD_32_loc remains in cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE INCLUDES .. if using the ../build subdir make
   gmake -f make_cntnm_sergio_run8 linuxINTELdbl
then the includes are NOT NEEDED (else you will have multiple definitons of
same subroutines)

but if you are making the /home/sergio/SPECTRA/CKDLINUX/calcon_3p2.F then you would
need the includes ....
