Then I went back to cntnm/src and copied/modified files so I can adappt to run8

-rw-rw-r-- 1 sergio pi_strow  26037 Nov 30 15:29 cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sergio pi_strow 700481 Jul 13 15:40 contnm_sergio.f90
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sergio pi_strow   4976 Jul 11 21:46 driver_cntnm_progr_sergio.f90

now the simple thing to do is to go to build and type
  gmake -f make_cntnm_sergio_run8 linuxGNUdbl
and if you are lucky it will work
and if you are unlucky it will not, probably giving errors such as
  cntnm_sergio_run8_v3.2_linux_gnu_dbl.obj/contnm_sergio.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `cntinf_'
  cntnm_sergio_run8_v3.2_linux_gnu_dbl.obj/cntnm_progr_sergio.o:(.bss+0x10): first defined here
  cntnm_sergio_run8_v3.2_linux_gnu_dbl.obj/contnm_sergio.o:(.bss+0x8): multiple definition of `bs296_'
  cntnm_sergio_run8_v3.2_linux_gnu_dbl.obj/cntnm_progr_sergio.o:(.bss+0x18): first defined here
because ... one of these calls the other unless you comment things out !!!

!!!!!  DO NOT UNCOMMENT if you use the /home/sergio/SPECTRA/CKDLINUX/MT_CKD3.2/cntnm/build/make
!!!!!  ONLY UNCOMMENT IF USING /home/sergio/SPECTRA/CKDLINUX/calconwater_locg_ckd3p2.sc

>>>>>> 
BECAUSE THE FOLLIOWING IS TRYING TO BE A STANDALONE SCRIPT !!!!!!!!
../../../calconwater_locg_ckd3p2.sc is what produces a mex file for run8
its mex interface is      calcon_loc_mtckd_32_wrap.F90
and this function calls
       call CALCON_MTCKD_32_loc(paveIN,ppaveIN,taveIN,num_kmolesIN, &
                               v1absIN,v2absIN,dvabsIN,                       &
                               raFreqDVS,raSelfDVS,raFornDVS,iNumPtsDVS,      &
                               raFreq,raAbs,iNumPts,                          &
	                       iGasID, rXSelf, rXForn, 0.0d0, 0.0d0, 0.0d0)

which is accomplished using
      include 'MT_CKD3.2/cntnm/src/cntnm_progr_sergio.f90'


so you have to make sure there is no infinite loop between
  cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
and
  driver_cntnm_progr_sergio.f90
calling each other
