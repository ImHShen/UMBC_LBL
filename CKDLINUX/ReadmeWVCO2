Dear Sergio,

Please find below the Table for the measured values of CA(CO2/H2O) in
the high frequency wing of the nu3 band of CO2. Since we measured
spectra at 50, 70 and 90Â°C and did not see any temperature dependence
for the CA(CO2/H2O), I cannot produce this CA at various
temperatures. In the absence of any other measurement and calculation,
one can assume that this CA is independent of temperature.

Best Regards

Ha

Dear Sergio, below are some answers

1- oncerning the intensities, you should convert them to the
considered temperature using units of cm-1/(molecule cm-2) and then
multiply them by 2.68678e19

2- When doin this you should include all CO2 lines, not only the nu_3 ones

3- Concerning the half-widths: Fits you should use H2O broadened half
widths, NOT air broadened (a referece providing their values should be
given in the paper (Sung et al if I remember properly). Then, if you
make a caculation at 1 amagat, you should multiply them by the
pressure P(atm) = T/T_0 where T_0=273.15 and T is the temperature of
interest.

These two changes should significantly increase your results, since;
(1) the broaening of CO2 lines by H2O is sinificantly larger than that
by air (basically a factor of 1.8), and (2) the pressure corresponding
to a density of 1 magat at 323 K is greater than 1

I will see if my colleague Ha can send you a fortran program today
Best regards
JM

Dear Sergio

We do not have a code to compute the CO2 absorption broadened by H2O
by taking LM into account.  What I suggest you to do is what we did,
which is the following

1 You compute the CO2 absorption in dry air using your tools (from
LBLRTM if I understood properly)? Now concerning the influence of
collisions with H2O, you can compte the absorption in the wings by
using the expressions and chi factor given in the attached paper. THis
is what we did: we computed a binary CO2+H2O continuum (normalized by
the product of the H2O and CO2 densities used in the calculation with
the chi factor) as a function of wavenumber and temperature and
tabulated it. We then include its contribution to the absorption by
simply interpolating and multiplying by the product of the densities
of CO2 and H2O. Although this is somehow a "patch" it is simple to
implement

I hope this answers your question. DO not hesitate to contact me if you need further information
Best regards
Jean-Michel
