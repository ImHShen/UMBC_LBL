dear Sergio
to get the LM data and software use and anonymous ftp to
 ftp.lisa.u-pec.fr
then go into the folder "lisa" and then into the folder "hartmann"
Download everything including the very numerous files that are inside
 the folder  "Daa_new"
The fortran program "LM_calc_CO2_new-coorected.for" is self sufficient
and contains a example of main program plus all needed routines
Note that the "parameters.inc" file is an include file that is used
to create the executable file. It should thus be put at the same place
as the main program

Note that there are a number of OPEN statements in the program, in
particular to read the data files (stored in folder "Data_new")
You may have to change the paths to these files according to your
operating system and to where you put all these data

Finally, when you run the program as it is, it will create a
"LM_Test.dat" file that should be indentical to the
Lm_TEST_new.dat that you have downloaded from the ftp

Finally, attached is the paper presenting these tools

Also, please be kind enough to keep me informed of the interesting
results you may get with these tools

Yours sincerely

Jean-Michel Hartmann
