for this /home/sergio/SPECTRA dir, co2_param.m was symbolically linked to 
 20 2007-06-11 02:37 co2_param.m -> co2_param_AIRS2002.m

But for /home/sergio/SPECTRA_2002 dir (which was saved in 2002), 
co2_param.m was symbolically linked to
 19 2007-06-11 02:37 co2_param.m -> co2_param_RAL_NEW.m

Using co2_param_test.m, this should NOT be anything different.
However, there is a difference with      co2_param_RAL_NEWALL.m

------------------------------------------------------------
We analysed RAL data, and i finally came up with a bunch of coefficients for 
the PR line mixing in the 4 um range

This is in co2_param_RAL_NEW.m
19 Feb  8  2001 co2_param.m -> co2_param_RAL_NEW.m

However, when comparing OBS-CALCS in 2385-2400 cm-1 we always have
  tObs-tCalcs < 0 from 2385->2400 cm-1
so calcs are too high ==> atmosphere too transeprent ==> k too low

look at the N2 gas amount jacobians 
/taro/s1/sergio/AIRSPRODUCTS_JACOBIANS/g22_jac.mat fout jout
even a 10% change in N2 amounts (or conversely, N2 abs coeffs) will only 
change the observed temperature by about 0.15 K

so slightly CHANGE effects of line mixing beta??????
use AIRS_FUDGE_FACTOR
see co2_param_AIRS2002.m    
 ... if you reduce beta, then you increase k
     eg reduce beta by 0.999, increase k by 0.01
 ... if you reduce duration of collision, then you increase k
     eg reduce dur by 0.999, increase k by 0.001
