Matlab procedures to read HITRAN IR cross section data

Version 1.1

H. Motteler, 3 Apr 00


The main Matlab procedures are

  calc_xsec.m     - interpolates or extrapolates tabulated xsec
                    data to an arbitray temperature profile; this 
		    is the "main" xsec routine 

  browse_xsec.m   - view selected tabulated or extrapolated data

  summary_xsec.m  - plots a overview of all the IR xsec data

  read_xsec.m     - reads a single gas HITRAN xsec file and returns 
                    the contents in a matlab structure

  split_xsec.m    - split a concatenated xsec file (e.g., HITRAN 92)
	            into individual gas files

The above procedures are documented as usual with Matlab ".m" files,
with initial comments accessible either directly or with the matlab
"help" command.

The tar file distribution also includes a "cleaned up" version of
the HITRAN 98 IR cross-section data.

See read_xsec.txt for more information.
